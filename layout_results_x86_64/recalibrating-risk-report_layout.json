For instance, it is well established that the vast majority \nof health impacts from Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi were not radiological, but rather psychosocial. There \nhas been an observable and dramatic increase in depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and suicides following \nthese events, which can be significantly attributed to the dissonance between the actual and perceived risks \nof radiation, and the stigmatization they caused. \n",

Indeed, several of these issues have been considerably exacerbated by the fact that \ncertain  risks  are  given  a  disproportionate  amount  of  focus,  whereas  others  are  de  facto  ignored.  The \nglobal conversation around climate change is a prime example of this. The historical use of fossil fuels has \ncontributed  significantly  to  climate  change  through  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  causing  unprecedented \nchanges in the liveability of the Earth. By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed \nareas, as extreme heat and droughts are exacerbating water resources. Between 2030 and 2050, climate \nchange  is  expected  to  be  the  cause  of  an  additional  250,000  deaths  per  year,  arising  from  malnutrition, \nmalaria, diarrhoea and heat stressx. Yet, despite the huge risks associated with climate change, our addiction \nto coal, oil, and fossil gas remains, with fossil fuels providing 84% of global primary energy in 2019xii. The \ncontinued prioritization of fossil fuels at the expense of nuclear energy results in a considerable increase in \nthe risks posed by climate change.\n",

The world's poorest 4 billion people consume a mere 5% of the energy used in \ndeveloped economies, and we need to find ways of delivering reliable electricity to the entire human population \nin  a  fashion  that  is  sustainable.  Household  and  ambient  air  pollution  causes  8.7  million  deaths  each  year, \nlargely because of the continued use of fossil fuels. Widespread electrification is a key tool for delivering a \njust energy transition. Investment in nuclear, has become an urgent necessity.
