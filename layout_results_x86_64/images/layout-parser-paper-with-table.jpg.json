Different from traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather than manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an object detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and makes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection. perform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:",

As document structures and layouts vary greatly in different domains, it is important to select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples.A semantic syntax is used for initializing the model weights in Layout Parser, using both the dataset",
