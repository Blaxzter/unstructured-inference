Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. zation pipelines.
