The said compounds are powerful factor B inhibitors and suppress the amplification of the complement system caused by C3 activation irrespective of the initial mecha- nism of activation (including for example activation of the classical, lectin or alternative pathways). WO2015/009616 discloses a wide variety of indications including the renal diseases atypicaly hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and glomerulonephritis including membrane proliferative glom- erulonephritis. It is silent about the use of the piperidinyl- indole derivatives in other renal diseases which are separate conditions with a distinctly different causality from the above, in particular it does not describe the use in classical HUS (£. coli induced hemolytic uremic syndrome) and membranous nephropathy. In contrast to the polypeptide construct according to WO2017/109208, the low molecular weight compounds as disclosed in WO2015/009616 specifi- cally inhibit the protease complement factor B, which is responsible for cleaving C3 and C5 of the AP. Thereby the direct generation of C3a, CS5a and C5b-9 through the clas- sical pathway is spared. In 2017, Konar and Dranoff (Konar M and Granoff D M 2017. Eculizumab treatment and impaired opsonophagocytic killing of meningococci by whole blood from immunized adults. Blood. 130(7):891- 899) have elegantly shown that selective inhibition of Factor D, the protease that activates FB, did not impair the protec- tive immune response against NV. meningitidis in vaccinated individuals, whereas inhibition at the level of CS does.

        "text": "The complement system is an important component of the innate immune system and comprises a cascade of proteases that are normally present in an inactive state. These pro- teases are organized in three activation pathways: the clas- sical, the lectin, and the alternative pathways that all con- verge on C3 and C5 cleavage and a common terminal pathway (V. M. Holers, In Clinical Immunology: Principles and Practice, ed. R. R. Rich, Mosby Press; 1996, 363-391). Molecules from microorganisms, antibodies or cellular com- ponents can activate these pathways resulting in the forma- tion of protease complexes known as the C3-convertases and the CS-convertases. The classical pathway is a calcium/ magnesium-dependent cascade, which is normally activated by the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. It can also be activated in an antibody-independent manner by the binding of C-reactive protein complexed to ligand and by many pathogens including gram-negative bacteria. The lec- tin pathway is also calcium and magnesium dependent and is normally stimulated by lectins. The alternative pathway is a magnesium-dependent cascade which 1s activated by depo- sition and activation of C3 on certain susceptible surfaces (e.g., cell wall polysaccharides of yeast and bacteria, and certain biopolymer materials). In addition to alternative pathway-specific stimulation, the alternative pathway also serves as an amplification loop for the other complement pathways. 20 25 40",

It describes a fusion construct in which mul- tiple active domains from naturally occurring complement regulators (complement factor H (FH) and complement FH related protein 1 (FHR1)) were combined to a single mol- ecule. The FH part of the molecule dissociates the C3 convertase of the AP, and at the same time acts as a cofactor of Complement factor I, which cleaves C3b to smaller, inactive fragments. In addition, the fusion construct also binds to C5 and inhibits the (AP) C5 convertase. Finally, the FHR1-part of the construct inhibits the classical complement pathway (CP), as shown in the Wieslab assay for classical pathway activity. Therefore this should result in a dual inhibition of the classical pathway and the alternative path- way/amplification loop. WO2015/009616 describes the syn-",

Alternative pathway activation of complement by Shiga toxin promotes exuberant C3a formation that triggers microvascular thrombosis. J /mmu- nol. 187(1):172-80), human microvascular endothelial cell line of dermal origin (HMEC-1, ATCC CRL-3243) were plated on glass slides and used when confluent. Cells were activated with 10 uM ADP for 10 minutes and then incu- bated for 4 hours with serum (collected from 3 STEC-HUS patients during the acute phase of the disease or healthy controls) diluted 1:2 with test medium (HBSS with 0.5% BSA), 1n the presence or in the absence of the CFB inhibitor of embodiment 5 at 2 different concentrations (1 and 10 microM). At the end of the incubation step HMEC-1 were treated with fluorochrome-conyugated anti-human C3c. In each experiment, a pool of sera from healthy controls was tested in parallel with patient serum. A confocal inverted laser microscope was used for acquisition of the fluorescent staining on endothelial cell surface. Fifteen fields per sample were acquired and the area occupied by the fluorescent staining was evaluated by auto- matic edge detection using built-in specific functions of the software Image J and expressed as p1xel2 per field analyzed. The highest and lowest values were discarded and the mean+SE was calculated on the remaining 13 fields. Results: Serum from patients with acute STEC-HUS induced a massive C3 deposition on ADP-activated endothe- lial cells in respect to sera from healthy controls (P<0.0001). The presence of the CFB inhibitor of embodiment 5 1n serum of STEC-HUS patients induced a dose-response decrease of C3 deposition on ADP-activated HMEC.-1 (73% reduction for 1 microM and 89% reduction for 10 microM, p<0.0001 for both). Notably the amount of C3 deposits on endothelial cells exposed to STEC-HUS serum added with the CFB inhibitor of embodiment 5 at 10 microM concentration did — 0 — 5 td 0 40",
